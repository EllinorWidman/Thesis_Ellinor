Based on news data that is labeled fake and real it will produce a style based classification and a matrix with  precision, recall and f1-score. Part of my thesis "#FakeNews- Validering av sanningshalten i nyhetsstr√∂mmar"

Make sure the following files are present as per the directory structure before running the code,

Prerequisites:
FakeNewsNet dataset is downloaded. Can be found here, https://github.com/KaiDMML/FakeNewsNet.git

Create working folders "Resultat" and "nltk_prep_result" both should have subfolders "Fake" and "Real"
Adjust folder paths in code to match.
